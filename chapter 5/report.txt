Pipeline 
no shared state 
a function takes an input and gives some ouput 
these functions are for sure Idempotance 

** I don't know if it is valid but i THINK Piplne style matches or can 
be called a functional prgramming

Yup I agree with the book the unit testing in this tpe of styling is much easier 

to talk about this type of programming
pipline is simple at so many leveles since let's say each function is independant 
no need for syncronization and concurrancy control
