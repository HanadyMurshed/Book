Since we have 2 constraints 
***naming
***memory limit

we are proccing line by line from a file to do that in typescript
we have to deal with streams since it's the only way I ound to 
laod strict amount of data from secondery to main memory.

The fs mmodule provide a varuois method and functions to 
deal tith streams (read streamd or write streams)

they are useaffull to deal with big data since they cme as chunk of data 
+ stdin/stdout they implement streams 
Streams write small amounts of data at a time. 
While this has the disadvantage of being slower 
because data is transferred in chunks, it has advantages 
for RAM performance.
