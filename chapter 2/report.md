## Chapter 2

I've noticed that dealing with stack is much easier than dealing with the scondery memory the way we did back in chapter 1. 
Moreover, it's much faster.
It was first challenging to referance only the last element in the stack but it was so much fun.


**In exc 2.2** first I found it useless to push the heap data into the stack and then pop it out to perform some 
opration when you can use the heap in the first place. but now I get it. it's how things are manpulated beyond the scene
It somehow rmindeds me of how assembly development was like. when you are allowed only to use a stack with a limited number of registers

The good old days when the developer used the forth language was really really good days
