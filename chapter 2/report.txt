I've noticed that dealing and with stack is much easier than dealing with the scondery memory the way wwe did back in chapter 1. 
Moreover, it's much faster.
It was first challenging to referance only the last element in the stack nut it was so much fun.
I don't know but in general, I think chapter 2 was entertaining.Moreover, it didn't take time as much as ch1 did
In exc 2.2 first I found it useless to push the heaap data into the stack and then pop it out to performs some 
opration when you can use the heap in the first place. but now I get it it's how things are manpulated beyond the scene
It somehow rminded me of how assembly development was like. when you are allowed only to use a stack with
a limited number of registers
The good old days when the developer used the foth language was really really good days
