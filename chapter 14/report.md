## Chapter 14: Hollywood
call me maybe

two entity e1,e2 instead of calling each itger directly
they regester thier calls in an even handler and it will do the jop instead 

**event driven development**

the eentitoes don't call ech other directly but like register thier calls 
so that the callee can trigger some action at some point (when an event occurs) to the calling entity 
the control is reversed between the calling and the callee
