two entity e1,e2 instead of calling each itger directly
they regester thier calls in an even handler and it will do the jop instead 
=======

14.1 Constraints

    Larger problem is decomposed into entities using some form of abstraction (objects, modules or similar).
    The entities are never called on directly for actions.
    The entities provide interfaces for other entities to be able to register callbacks.
    At certain points of the computation, the entities call on the other entities that have registered for callbacks

event driven development 
the eentitoes don't call ech other directly but like register thier calls 
so that the callee can trigger some action at some point (when an event occurs) to the calling entity 
the control is reversed between the calling and the callee
