textual brevity may not be the best answer
for sure gold code is much easier to read and understand 
I don't think that this type of programming is the best
or even close to the best cuz yes external 3-ed part lib may be dangerouse 
and they may be integrated in a wrong way with my code 
beside the source code is often unavaiiable 
so you need to ask you're self how much trusted this source can be ? 
and doese it worth the resk ? 

I've been told once by my lecture how much he was struggling whith 
his code bc of a bug that he couldnt find where he integrating 
some external source code. After 2 weeks of struggling,
 he founded the source of the bug which was the external code .

 So I'm not a big fan of this style of programming 

 spend some time to code it yourself 

 but ofcourse I'm not against the reusabiity of prebuiit units 
 I'm just saying you need to be carefull of what you are putting in your code
