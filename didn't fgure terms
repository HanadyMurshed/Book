aka functions
box functions
textual brevity may not be the best answer
for sure gold code is much easier to read and understand 
I don't think that this type of programming is the best
or even close to the best cuz yes external 3-ed part lib may be dangerouse 
and they may be integrated in a wrong way with my code 
beside the source code is often unavaiiable 
so you need to ask you're self how much trusted this source can be ? 
and doese it worth the resk ?
