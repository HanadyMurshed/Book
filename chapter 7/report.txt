infinit mirror 
first of all I loved the way they solved he problemm of 
stackoverflow sinc they only sent the exact size of the stack 
and for the tail recursion 
we used it in our code before without knowing the effect it had for the number of calls 
acutaly it is said that a tail recursion shoul never suffer from stackoverflow
but of course it depends on the language if it support tail recoursion
 optmization in the first place 
 in theory js support tail-call optmization
 but I found that only safari implement this optmizations
