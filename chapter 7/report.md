## Chapter 7: infinit mirror 
first of all I loved the way they solved he problemm of 
stackoverflow since they only sent the exact size of data that won't cause the stack to overflow

**Tail recursion**
we used it in our early coding stages
 but  without knowing the effect it has for the number of calls a stack can handle.

Acutaly it is said that a tail recursion should never suffer from stackoverflow
**but** of course it depends on the language wehter it supports tail recoursion
 optmization or not.

 in theory js support tail-call optmization
 but I found that only safari implement this optmizations
