hmmm for this style of programming. I think it is not that attractive since the 
monolithic devloping style means to develope that single long hard-to-understad code
Moreover, when using this aprrouch, the whole code is tightly related and dependant, 
so any error at any place will cause the whole system to collapse. 
I would talk the oppisite approuch modular development is more stable
at the end, the monolithic style may be good at developing really small chunk of codes
but for a big system. I think it is catastrophic 
spend some time at breaking the code into tasks is much usefull
