## Chapter 3 

#### It is simple bad becuase 
- you have to develope that single long hard-to-understad code
-  when using this aprrouch, the whole code is tightly related and dependant, 
so any error at any place will cause the whole system to collapse. 

I would talk the oppisite approuch modular development is more stable.

at the end, the monolithic style may be good at developing really small chunks of codes
but for a big system. I think it is **catastrophic** .

Spending some time breaking the code into tasks is much usefull
