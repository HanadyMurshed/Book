kick forward 
hmmm enhanced pipline
where the next function to be applied is put passed as a parameter and applied at the end of the current function
I thinj this function compotion is so smart 
callback hell which i suffered from in chapter 1 ^^ 
still I thin that this way of calling and passing function is so clever 
bc js is single threaded it uses this aprrouch so much to ensure the continouty 
of the system when theere is some blocking i/o requests
