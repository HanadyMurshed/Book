## Chapter 9: The one 

I think that his approuch is better than that kick compostion becuase:
 
- first you can use composition without changing the way the these functions were coded 
- second you can freely alter the order and remove some fuunctions from the chain of functions easlly


**in 9.2 exc:**  The wrpper we used returns a function that 
when called, it returns the value of the data 
I'm new to this types of programming but I think the wrapper returned a function 
instead of the data maybee to postpond the wrapping to some advanced stage or to divide 
the wrapping proccess into 2 phases 


**for example**

- the first phase is when the wrap function is called 
- seconde when the actual data is needed
 in the bind function for example

 I think I can also define several wrappers snce the wrapping criterea may change from phase to phase
