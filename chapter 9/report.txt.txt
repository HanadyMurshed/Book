I think that his aprouch is better than that kick compostion since 
first you can use composition without changing the way the these functions were coded 
second you can freely alter the order and remove some fuunctions from the chain of functions easlly


in 9.2 exc:  The wrpper we used returns a function that 
when called, it returns the value of the data 
I'm new to this types of programming but I think the wrapper returned a function 
instead of the data maybee to postpond the wrapping to an advanced stage or to divide 
the wrapping proccess into 2 phases for example 
the first phase is when the wrap function is called 
and a seconde when the actual data is needed
 in the bind function for example
