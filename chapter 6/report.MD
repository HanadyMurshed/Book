## Chapter 6: Golf code
### the shorter the better
- textual brevity may not be the best answer
- for sure golf code is much easier to code
- I don't think that this type of programming is the best

It depends on how you are using it 
cuz external 3-ed party lib may be dangerous 
and they might be integrated in a wrong way.
beside the source code is often unavaiiable 
so you need to ask you're self how much trusted this source can be ? 
and **doese it worth the resk**? 

I've been told once by my lecturer how much he was struggling with 
his code bc of a bug that he couldn't find where he was integrating 
some external units. After 2 weeks of struggling, he founded the source of the bug which was the external unit.

 So I'm not a big fan of this style of programming 

 **but of course I'm not against the reusabiity of prebuiit units**

 I'm just saying you need to be carefull of what you are putting into your code 

 source line of code is used to measre how large is a programm
