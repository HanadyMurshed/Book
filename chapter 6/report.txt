Golf code : the shorter the better
textual brevity may not be the best answer
for sure golf code is much easier to read and understand 
I don't think that this type of programming is the best
It depends on how you are using it 
cuz external 3-ed party lib may be dangerouse 
and they may be integrated in a wrong way.
beside the source code is often unavaiiable 
so you need to ask you're self how much trusted this source can be ? 
and doese it worth the resk ? 

I've been told once by my lecture how much he was struggling whith 
his code bc of a bug that he couldnt find where he integrating 
some external source code. After 2 weeks of struggling,
he founded the source of the bug which was the external code .

 So I'm not a big fan of this style of programming 

 but ofcourse I'm not against the reusabiity of prebuiit units 
 I'm just saying you need to be carefull of what you are putting in your code
