abstract things 

13.1 Constraints

    The larger problem is decomposed into abstract things that make sense for the problem domain.
    Each abstract thing is described by what operations the things of that abstraction can eventually do.
    Concrete things are then bound, somehow, to the abstractions; mechanisms for doing that vary.
    The rest of the application uses the things not by what they are but by what they do in the abstract.

the seconde line refers to interface I think 

now since typescript or even java script doesn't support abstract classes 
but uses interfaces as the abstract unit used to define the structure of an entitiy 
we are going to solve this problem using interfaces
