in typescript it will produce a compile error that the required methoed is msssing in that defined class
that make since since the interface define the structure of the object nd all the must have opration

but for python and using tha ABS library I think the regester function will produce some error at the ruun time 
i'l try running the python code 

regester function can't be find 
but the class that was inherting from an abstract class with a missing implementation
had given a compiler error of that missing functions
